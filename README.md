Description:
This Product Management App is a conceptual project developed as part of a coding assessment. It is not intended for production use but serves as a demonstration of my skills in full-stack development. The app simulates a typical inventory management system, offering basic functionality to manage products, track inventory, and view sales data. While the app showcases foundational features, it remains a work in progress and exemplifies my approach to problem-solving and software design.

Please note that this application is a prototype and has been developed under the constraints of an assessment timeline. As such, it might lack the comprehensive error handling, optimization, and security features that would be necessary for a production environment.

Key Features:
Product Catalog: An interface to simulate adding, updating, and deleting product information.
Inventory Tracking: A rudimentary system to track product quantities and simulate inventory management.
Sales Reporting: Basic reporting tools to illustrate how sales data could be visualized and analyzed.
User Management: A simple demonstration of user authentication and authorization processes.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB
APIs: RESTful API services


Setup Instructions Prerequisites:
Node.js
MongoDB
npm or yarn

Installation: 
1.) Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-management-app.git

2.) cd product-management-app

3.) npm install

4.) Change to the backend directory of the app 
cd backend
And run the command as 
node index.js 

5.) Similarly open another terminal go to the project directory and write
cd frontend 
And run the command 
npm start 
which should start the development server on your machine
